# Tiles

Tiles, a game where you start with nothing and build your own town and manage resources. This is a simulation game I am working on. The game is a 2d pixelated style management simulation where tiles can be upgraded. See the Readme for the timeline and where the game is at right now.

# Development Info

*Currently the game is not ready for testing, but you can sign up for testing in the discord server for the game when it is made.*

**How I Update**

*I will be releasing big updates every few months followed by a few small patches to the new update a few days after.*

# How to Play

# Common Bugs

I have found a weird bug with Java when pulling code from Github. It breaks with different weird bugs such as main not found or input of a commented out function is null.
I do not know how to fix this other than tring a bunch of different things to get it to work correctly.
Theses include: 
  Using the Github desktop app to clone the repository before running the code.
  Copying an image from Data/ImageData and deleting the old one and renaming the copy to match the old one.
