# Tiles

Tiles, a game where you start woth nothing and build your own town and manage resources. This is a simulation game I am working on. The game is a 2d pixelated style management simulation where tiles can be upgraded. See the Readme for the timeline and where the game is at right now.

# Development Info

*Currently the game is not ready for testing, but you can sign up for testing in the discord server for the game when it is made.*

**How I Update**

*I will be releasing big updates every few months followed by a few small patches to the new update a few days after.*
