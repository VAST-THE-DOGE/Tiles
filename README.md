# Tiles

Tiles, a game where you start with nothing and build your own town and manage resources. This is a simulation game I am working on. The game is a 2d pixelated style management simulation where tiles can be upgraded. See the Readme for the timeline and where the game is at right now.

# Development Info

*Currently the game is not ready for testing, but you can sign up for testing in the discord server for the game when it is made.*

**How I Update**

*I will be releasing big updates every few months followed by a few small patches to the new update a few days after.*

# How to Play

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Java (lateset version if possible) is needed to run the game!

Setup:
  Make sure you have Java installed
  Extract the game from the zip folder.
  Launch the game by double clicking "Main.jar"
  If it crashes immediately, try opening the terminal in the folder and type: "java -jar Main.jar"

Gameplay:
  wip

# Common Bugs

not opening with a double click.
To fix, try using the terminal to open the game.

# Feedback and Reporting Bugs

I feel like this game is at too early of a stage to start fixing bugs that do not break the game.
